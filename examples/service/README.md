# Service

This is an example of creating a micro service.

## Contents

- main.go - is the main definition of the service, handler and client
- proto - contains the protobuf definition of the API

## Run the example

运行服务

```shell
go run main.go
```

运行 client

```shell
go run main.go --run_client
```

And that's all there is to it.
